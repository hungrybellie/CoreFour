![Title that says Core Four](https://github.com/hungrybellie/CoreFour/assets/63426032/d2b82164-c006-449b-a227-bcd8762edd30)

# CoreFour

Our world is becoming more and more polluted from the effects of overconsumption. Overconsumption can be defined as the excessive act of consuming goods and services. As humans, past our necessities, we honestly don't need many things. There's no need to buy every new trending item, or more clothes than what's likely already in your closet. Often times excess of these items end up in landfills or polluting our environments. It has been reported that over 92 million **tons** of clothing end up in landfills every year, and that's **just** clothing waste. I believe that this issue can begin to be remedied if people were just a little more mindful of their purchases. This was my main driving factor for creating _Core Four_.
